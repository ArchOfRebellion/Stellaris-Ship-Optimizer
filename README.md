# Stellaris-Ship-Optimizer
This program optimizes a Stellaris ship based on enemy intelligence.

To run this program:
Download the following files:
1. auxiliaries.csv - this has the data on all the ship auxiliaries
2. defenses.csv - this has the data on all the ship defenses
3. weapons.csv - this has the data on all of the ship weapons
4. utilities.csv - this has data on all the utilities, including reactors, thrusters, etc.
5. tech.csv - this is the csv where you'll put your current technology
6. intelligence.csv - this is your intelligence on one or more enemies. Currently has some data on a devouring swarm that was harassing me
7. Optimizer v1 - this folder has the install file for the optimizer. Download and install!

To Run:
1. Update the tech.csv to reflect your techs in game
2. Update the intelligence.csv to match what you know about your enemies. Refer to the 'permissableValues' for what you should call weapons, defenses, etc. NOTE THAT THE OPTIMIZER IS DUMB, IT CAN ONLY HANDLE ENTRIES THAT ARE EXACT.
3. Install the optimizer
4. Run the installer - it will prompt you for the folder with all of the csv files.
5. Check out the results when it finishes!
